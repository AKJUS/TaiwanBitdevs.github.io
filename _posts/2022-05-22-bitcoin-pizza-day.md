我們都可以紀念拉茲洛的傳奇。 雖然他以 10,000 BTC 購買 2 個棒約翰披薩而廣為人知，但他是最早放棄 CPU 以利用 GPU 產生哈希並永遠改變了挖礦的礦工之一。

We will celebrate Lazlo. While he his widely known today for paying 10,000 BTC for 2 Papa Johns pizza, he was one of the earliest miners to move off of CPUs to leverage GPUs to produces hashes and changed mining forever.
