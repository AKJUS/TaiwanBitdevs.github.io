## Announcements

Our 27th Socratic Seminar event will be held at TempoHouse

Tempohouse generously offered their space to host BitDevs

This time would like to take the opportunity to go over something more Taiwan-centric alongside the usual socratic

Bitcoin is the worlds first global digital money, and money speaks all languages. To use Bitcoin is to communicate with the world which throughout history Taiwanese have been eager to do. Taiwanese also contributes to Bitcoin in a meaningful way, let's explore the unique aspects of how Taiwan is drawn to Bitcoin .

Learn about bitcoin development. Share, debate, and discuss trade offs in progress. We discuss a variety of developments, from industry updates and press releases, pull requests in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, rust-bitcoin, Joinmarket, WasabiWallet), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs, network monitors and more. Please add to the discussion topics on GitHub. We'd love to hear from you. After the event the we socialize over food and drinks.

我們每月舉辦的蘇格拉底式的研討會活動旨在促進辯論、信息共享和開放討論。在活動前幾週,聚會成員會從各種來源去整理討論主題：流行git倉儲（例如 Bitcoin Core、lnd、c-lightning、rust-bitcoin, Joinmarket、WasabiWallet）中的pull requests、研究論文、技術博客帖文、IRC 日誌、網絡監測等。經過一段時間的討論，一些活動會有來自開源項目、公司、研究和其他相關內容的介紹。隨後是反饋和問答部分。活動結束後，我們會在活動場地進行社交。

## Discussion Topics

###TBD

### Nostr, zaps and stuff (always)

Taiwan BitDevs would like to explore Nostr with the audience by generating an npub with the audience present to follow along.
Nostr stands for "notes and other stuff transmitted over relays" it is a protocol designed around censorship resistance which can be used for social media. Nostr is a lot of fun and a great way to use Lightning Network (NIP-57 / zaps / LNURL)

#### NIP update - nostr marketplace (NIP-15)
Theres an LNBits extension that allows you to list and shop for goods using nostr relays and get paid through Bitcoin/Lightning
