## Discussion Topics

### Stranded: How Bitcoin is saving wasted energy and expanding financial freedom in Africa

Alex Gladstein has a great article about how Bitcoin Mining greates value for communities by tapping into stranded Energy.
Translated this article to chinese because I think this story is important for Taiwanese

Note: These are all made possible with Taiwanese exports (ASICs, nodes, networking equipment)

### Coinbase has removed support for native Bitcoin payments on Coinbase Commerce claiming it was too big of a challenge for the company.

Delivering these same capabilities on the Bitcoin blockchain without smart contracts and stablecoins was challenging & we therefore made the difficult decision to remove native Bitcoin & other UTXO support," she added.

Coinbase Commerce now no longer receives Bitcoin from non-Coinbase users

Note: To date Coinbase still has not implemented lightning

### Elizabeth Warren Trolled Into Honoring Satoshi Nakamoto on 15th Bitcoin's Launch Anniversary

Senator Elizabeth Warren honored Satoshi Nakamoto for the 15th anniversary of the network’s launch with a commemorative flag flown over the United States Capitol, although the service is available to anyone willing to pay a fee.
"In participation of the Capitol Flag Program, Senator Warren’s office submitted a request to commemorate Nakamoto’s accomplishment of creating the first “truly inclusive financial system,” with the colors of the United States being flown above the Capitol on December 18, 2023 – a date known to Bitcoiners as HODL Day," wrote Mark Goodwin in an entertaining article for Bitcoin Magazine.
US regulators for the first time approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in Bitcoin, a move heralded as a landmark event for the roughly $1.7 trillion digital-asset sector that will broaden access to the largest cryptocurrency on Wall Street and beyond.

### Bitwise's Bitcoin Spot ETF Addresses Updated to Native SegWit P2WPKH

"Investors will continue to be able to verify BITB’s holdings transparently on-chain, a unique capability that’s fundamental to the bitcoin blockchain. All are listed at http://bitbetf.com."

Bitwise is one of two Bitcoin spot ETF providers that's allocating a portion (10%) of its ETF proceeds to support open source Bitcoin development (no strings attached). Late in January, it became the first Bitcoin spot ETF to publicly disclose its bitcoin holding addresses.
It didn't take long. Just two days after BlackRock and other bitcoin spot ETFs began trading, we can reveal at least one on-chain address that belongs to BlackRock.

### Stripe De-platforming Miners

Stripe is a digital payments provider.

Bitcoin consulting service and hardware store Bitsaga.be has been deplatformed by payment processor Stripe for offering Bitcoin mining equipment on its site.

"We understand that your business may be legal, but for now, due to various reasons, including requirements that apply to Stripe as a payment processor, requirements from our financial partners, and the potential risk exposure to Stripe, we're currently not able to work with certain industries."

### Elizabeth Warren Wants to Extend Bank Secrecy Act Regulations to Free & Open Source Software

The bill aims to extend Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements including know-your-customer (KYC) rules to miners, validators, wallet providers and others.

The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act would: 

* Extend Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) responsibilities, including Know-Your-Customer requirements, to digital asset wallet providers, miners, validators, and other network participants that may act to validate, secure, or facilitate digital asset transactions.
* Address a major gap with respect to “unhosted” digital wallets – which allow individuals to bypass AML and sanctions checks – by directing FinCEN to finalize and implement its December 2020 proposed rule, which would require banks and money service businesses (MSBs) to verify customer and counterparty identities, keep records, and file reports in relation to certain digital asset transactions involving unhosted wallets or wallets hosted in non-BSA compliant jurisdictions.
* Direct FinCEN to issue guidance to financial institutions on mitigating the risks of handling, using, or transacting with digital assets that have been anonymized using digital asset mixers and other anonymity-enhancing technologies. 
* Strengthen enforcement of BSA compliance by directing the Treasury Department to establish an AML/CFT compliance examination and review process for MSBs and other digital asset entities with BSA obligations and directing the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish AML/CFT compliance examination and review processes for the entities they regulate. 
* Extend BSA rules regarding reporting of foreign bank accounts to include digital assets by requiring United States persons engaged in a transaction with a value greater than $10,000 in digital assets through one or more offshore accounts to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) with the Internal Revenue Service. 
* Mitigate the illicit finance risks of digital asset ATMs by directing FinCEN to ensure that digital asset ATM owners and administrators regularly submit and update the physical addresses of the kiosks they own or operate and verify customer and counterparty identity.

Note: Often Republic of China/Taiwan policy follows suit with the US, so best to keep alert on what is happening with the KYC/AML side -- however generally everyone is already KYC'ed

### BTCPayServer - LNBank Plugin Exploit (Update: LNBank is being phased out)

LNbank is a plugin for BTCPay Server to use the internal Lightning node in custodial mode: It allows server admins to open up the Lightning node and give users access via custodial layer 3 wallets. All users of BTCPay Server's LNbank plugin are urged to upgrade to to v1.8.9 as soon as possible.

Note: This is a form of hot wallet risk. Software running on lightning nodes often have full control of the node in question which means any vulnerability found in that software can be used to steal balances.  Recommend to be careful of what apps to run, and secure authentication token files properly (LND uses special cookies called macaroons)

### Discussion on CVE-2023-50428 / Vulnerability in Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots (Remains Open!)

Why this is a CVE - the software which creates these OP_IF/FALSE/PUSH transactions circumvents the existing filters, and there is no such mechanism is in place to to recognize these transactions as non-standard (there are no configuration options to address this).

datacarrier and datacarrier size parameters in bitcoin.conf does not include inscription transactions

Companies and individuals maintain their own versions of Bitcoin software and should be monitoring vulnerabilities across their stack. Ultimately everyone can decide whether or not a CVE applies to them, whether or not vulnerability should be classified as such is not the issue, it is a situation to address.

There is a patch available as commit #28408, the patch does not censor ordinals, it simply subjects an expanded set of transactions which inscribe data onto the blockchain to go through the same filters as before. The miners aligned with the patch are forgoing mining fees to run this filter.

Nodes which apply the patch have the drawbacks of fee-estimations being off and slower block validation times.

Note: demonstration available on how to apply the patch (homework!)

### A lesson in UTXO management (Coinbase)

An NFT project has been taking in deposits through Coinbase as a way to 'consolidate' utxos. Giving Coinbase many small utxos which they will need to combine sometime down the road

### Nostr, zaps and stuff (always)

Taiwan BitDevs would like to explore Nostr with the audience by generating an npub with the audience present to follow along.
Nostr stands for "notes and other stuff transmitted over relays" it is a protocol designed around censorship resistance which can be used for social media. Nostr is a lot of fun and a great way to use Lightning Network (NIP-57 / zaps / LNURL)

#### NIP update - nostr marketplace (NIP-15)
Theres an LNBits extension that allows you to list and shop for goods using nostr relays and get paid through Bitcoin/Lightning
