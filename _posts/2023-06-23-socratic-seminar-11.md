### Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com and others under scrutiny from the SEC

SEC issuing charges on crypto exchanges for listing unregistered securities, co-mingling funds, and circumventing US financial regulation. Important to point out that Bitcoin is outside of this

### BlackRock registers for a Spot Bitcoin "ETF"

Asset management giant BlackRock took the first steps Thursday to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which has long been a point of contention between crypto advocates and federal regulators.

The firm filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust. If approved, the ETF would allow easy access for investors to get exposure to crypto in a product from one of Wall Street’s largest companies.

As exciting as it is to have BlackRock enter the space so thaat Grayscale is no longer the only game in town, it is important to remember that Larry Fink once called Bitcoin an "index of money laundering", and this product does not have any form of gurantee for actual Bitcoin redemption/settlement

### Ledger Live update debacle

Ledger Recover is a custody service offered to Ledger users. Users were outraged to find out that updated versions of firmware are able to gain private key access, CEO and CTO offers to clarify Ledger's position. Hardware wallets all have security trade-offs

### BTCPrague Are Ordinals Retarded?

Giacomo Zucco gives a 30 minute presentation on the history of the concept of colored coins and data encoding on the blockchain.  Using the definition of "delayed development" instead of the colloquial insult. It is important to tell the truth about what happened in Bitcoin so that others can learn from mistakes of the past.

### Ark, another proposal for a Bitcoin second layer

Ark allows recipients to receive payments without acquiring inbound liquidity while preserving their receiver privacy. The protocol is as private as WabiSabi, as convenient as on-chain, and as cheap as Lightning

### Nostr, zaps and stuff (again)

Taiwan BitDevs would like to explore Nostr with the audience by generating an npub with the audience present to follow along.
Nostr stands for "notes and other stuff transmitted over relays" it is a protocol designed around censorship resistance which can be used for social media. Nostr is a lot of fun and a great way to use Lightning Network (NIP-57 / zaps / LNURL)
